Mastermind notes and approaches
My approaches:

1. Construct the board
2. Display the board
3. Hints -- X is right position, O is right color, wrong decision


Construct code breaker logic
1. Computer creates code randomly
2. User guesses code
3. Check code
4. Return response
5. Repeat 2-4 as needed

Construct code maker logic
1. User inputs code
2. Computer guesses code following algorithm
3. check code
4. deply response
5. repeat 2-4 as needed


notes

X is right number, Right place
0 is right number, Wrong place


Pseudocode for checking guess
take a guess in
Check: how many guesses are the correct number in the correct solution?
show hints correctly
for each remaining item
  if so, add an item to the hint and
  delete the first number that matches the guesssed number in the solution
